In order to use the hand lens to magnify an object, place the object on the bench and move the hand lens from the object towards the eye until an enlarged image is seen. If a hand lens is used to make a drawing, the lens magnification does not determine the drawing’s magnification. Drawing magnification = length of the drawing ÷ length of the object.
